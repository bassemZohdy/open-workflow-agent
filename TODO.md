# Open Workflow Agent Backlog

`Project Definition.md` is the architecture/product authority. `PROJECT.md` records verified implementation state. `AGENTS.md` defines repository rules. This file contains the scoped backlog and intentionally deferred work.

## Current Phase

**`v0.2.0` is released from verified commit `5d1bce6309654c3ada632483fbae71d0404cc33d`; no active scoped backlog items remain.**

The public contract remains Open Workflow 1.0.3. The runtime uses a framework-neutral common executor and deployment-selected ADK or LangGraph envelopes; it does not claim task-level native compilation or full Open Workflow/A2A conformance.

## Active backlog

No active scoped backlog items remain. Completed work and release evidence are
recorded in `PROJECT.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`. The intentionally deferred scope
below is not scheduled until its stated product or security prerequisites exist.

## Intentionally deferred

### A2A push notifications

Push notifications remain deferred because they introduce an outbound callback trust boundary requiring callback allowlisting, TLS/server identity verification, SSRF controls, callback authentication, replay/idempotency protection, bounded retries/dead-letter behavior, and secret-safe observability.

### Full A2A conformance claim

A broad/full A2A conformance claim remains deferred. The bounded async/streaming profile and advertised-capability evidence are complete, but broader interoperability and conformance gates are outside the current scope. Advertise only the implemented bounded profile.

### Microsoft Agent Framework production status

The optional adapter remains CI-covered but is not a production image/release target. Independent runtime image, hardened-image acceptance, persistence/resume coverage, capability reporting, and release metadata remain deferred.

### Multi-tenancy

Multi-tenancy is outside the current product scope. New security/profile/persistence structures should avoid obvious future tenant-isolation blockers, but no tenant model or tenant-aware behavior should be implemented now.

### Delegated user identity

User delegation, token exchange, and consent are deferred until a concrete enterprise A2A/MCP requirement exists. When introduced, use standards-based identity infrastructure rather than custom protocol message fields.

### AsyncAPI implementation

AsyncAPI 3.1.0 is pinned as a future binding baseline but is not implemented. No active work is planned until a concrete event-integration requirement exists.

## Working rules

- Use the official A2A Project definitions as the source of truth for A2A wire behavior.
- Add or update deterministic tests before marking implementation tasks complete.
- Keep core framework-neutral; engine packages own framework-specific behavior only.
- Route executable workflow operations through the common `SandboxManager`.
- Preserve separate knowledge, memory, session, checkpoint, invocation, approval, schedule, sandbox, and engine-native state lifecycles.
- Production capabilities remain fail-closed until required tests and acceptance gates are green.
- Protocol baseline changes are compatibility changes, not ordinary dependency bumps.
- Authentication and authorization are deployment/runtime configuration; workflows never contain raw credentials.
- Do not claim exactly-once side effects merely because a checkpoint exists; side-effecting callers must be idempotent.
- Run focused checks for each slice and the full CI-shaped matrix for completed meaningful slices, main integration, and release acceptance.
